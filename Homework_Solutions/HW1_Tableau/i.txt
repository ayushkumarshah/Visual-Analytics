1. The menu structure of Tableau changes drastically from one version to the
next. Can you navigate this tutorial in the next (or previous) version of
Tableau?

Ans:
It is generally difficult to keep up with the changes in the menu structure in
a menu driven program like tableau. However, I was able to navigate this tutorial
in the new version of Tableau as the menu structure was pretty similar to the
one taught in the video.


2. Different chart types are recommended for different types of data. How would
you characterize these chart types? What is it about the data that leads to the
recommendations?

Ans:
There are different chart types in tableau. They can be characterized as:

## Bar Chart:
Bar charts are one of the most common data visualizations. It is used to quickly
compare data across categories, highlight differences, show trends and outliers,
and reveal historical highs and lows at a glance.

## Line Chart
The line chart, or line graph, connects several distinct data points, presenting
them as one continuous evolution. We use line charts to view trends in data,
usually over time.

## Pie Chart
Pie charts are powerful for adding detail to other visualizations in a circular
shape, which can be analyzed at once.

## Maps
Maps are used for visualizing any kind of location information, whether itâ€™s
postal codes, state abbreviations, country names, or your own custom geocoding.

## Scatter Plot
Scatter plots are an effective way to investigate the relationship between
different variables, showing if one variable is a good predictor of another,
or if they tend to change independently. A scatter plot presents lots of distinct
data points on a single chart.

## Gantt Chart
Gantt charts display a project schedule or show changes in activity over time.
A Gantt chart shows steps that need to be completed before others can begin,
along with resource allocation.

The nature of data i.e. whether it is categorical or numerical, or if it is
geographical, etc leads to the recommendations. For example: Bar charts are
especially effective when data can be split into multiple categories. Similarly,
if geographic information is associated with the data, maps are a simple and
compelling way to show how location correlates with trends in the data.


3. Is Tableau biased in any way? Is it easier to make some kinds
of arguments with Tableau than others?

Ans: Yes, tableau is biased since it relies on measurements. So, it will be
easier to make arguments about easily measurable quantities. However, some
things are harder to measure. For example, love, time are difficult to measure.


4. Tableau accepts live data and allows you to connect your visualization to live,
changing data. Suppose the point you are trying to make is no longer supported by
data in future. Will you be blamed for that change?

Ans: Yes, I think that I will be blamed for that change since conditions may
change in the future and I may be still associated with that tool, which is
a big potential source of trouble.


5. Tableau makes a lot of default choices that you changed. Do you think it could
(or should) learn your preferences over time? What would it take to do that?

Ans:
Yes, I think it should and it can learn my preferences over time. It would need
to store my data on how I use the software and adapt the default choices
utilizing that data. There might be privacy issues, however, it can develop some
policies on what type of data can it store. It can also use information on how
other people use Tableau to enhance the choices.


6. What is a data visualization? What would have to be subtracted from these
pictures so that they could not be called data visualizations?

Ans: Data visualization is the graphical representation of information and data.
By using visual elements like charts, graphs, and maps, data visualization tools
provide an accessible way to see and understand trends, outliers, and patterns
in data.

All the visual features like lines, bars, maps, legends, trend lines, markers,
etc must be subtracted from these pictures so that they could not be called
data visualizations.

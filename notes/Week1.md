 retinal variables

 A system for producing graphics

 1. invariant (thing that stays same across all relationships in the graphic,
    title for graphic, topic - e.g. sales by county)
 
 2. the components (they vary, represented by legend e.g. sales). Each component
    has 3 properties to analyze: 
    - order
    - length - no of divisions
    - level - nominal, ordered, or quantitative concept

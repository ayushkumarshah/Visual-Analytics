This file is based on the blog post at
[https://sebastiansauer.github.io/figure_sizing_knitr/](https://sebastiansauer.github.io/figure_sizing_knitr/)

```{r initial sizing}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.width=12,fig.height=8)
```

The first plot follows.

```{r fig1, fig.height=3,fig.width=5}
plot(pressure)
```

The second plot follows.

```{r fig2, fig.height=3,fig.width=3,fig.align="center"}
plot(pressure)
```

The third plot follows.

```{r fig3, fig.width=5,fig.asp=0.62}
plot(pressure)
```

The fourth plot follows.

```{r fig4,fig.height=4,fig.width=3}
plot(pressure)
```

The fifth plot follows. Note that the specification in percentage is allowed if you render straight to pdf but may not work if you render first to html.

```{r fig5,out.width='40%'}
plot(pressure)
```

Change figure sizes like this:

```
![name](file.jpg){width=50%}
```
